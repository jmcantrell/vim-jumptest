INTRODUCTION                                      *jumptest* *jumptest.vim*

In many unit-test systems, it's common for the tests to be stored alongside the
corresponding file that is being tested (e.g. 'foo.test.py' provides test
coverage for 'foo.py'). This plugin provides a command that jumps between these
two files.

CONFIGURATION                                     *jumptest-configuration*

g:jumptest_loaded                                 *g:jumptest_loaded*
    If set in your |vimrc|, jumptest.vim is not loaded.

g:jumptest_tag                                    *g:jumptest_tag*
    A |String| used as the identifier for the test file (e.g. if the main file
    is 'foo.py' and |g:jumptest_tag| is "test", then the test file is expected
    to be 'foo.test.py').

b:jumptest_tag                                    *b:jumptest_tag*
    If this is set, it will be used instead of |g:jumptest_tag|.

If neither |b:jumptest_tag| nor |g:jumptest_tag| is set, then 'test' will be
used.

FUNCTIONS

jumptest#alt_file({fname}, {tag})                 *jumptest#alt_file()*
    Return the alternate filename of {fname}. The value of {tag} should be
    a string like 'test' or 'spec' that is used when constructing the
    main/alternate filename. For example, when {fname} is 'foo.py' and {tag}
    is 'test' then 'foo.test.py' will be returned. Conversely, if {fname} is
    'foo.test.py' and {tag} is 'test' then 'foo.py' will be returned.

jumptest#jump()                                   *jumptest#jump()*
    Does the same thing as |:JumpTest| but more convenient for scripting.

COMMANDS

                                                  *:JumpTest*
:JumpTest               Jump to/from the test file for the current buffer.
                        If the buffer has no file, nothing will happen.
