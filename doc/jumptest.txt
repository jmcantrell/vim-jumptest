INTRODUCTION                                      *jumptest* *jumptest.vim*

In many unit-test systems, it's common for the tests to be stored alongside the
corresponding file that is being tested (e.g. `foo.test.py` provides test
coverage for `foo.py`). This plugin provides a command that jumps between these
two files.

CONFIGURATION                                     *jumptest-configuration*

g:jumptest_loaded                                 *g:jumptest_loaded*
    If set in your |vimrc|, jumptest.vim is not loaded.

g:jumptest_tag                                    *g:jumptest_tag*
    A |String| used as the identifier for the test file (e.g. if the main file
    is `foo.py` and `g:jumptest_tag` is "test", then the test file is expected
    to be `foo.test.py`).

b:jumptest_tag                                    *b:jumptest_tag*
    If this is set, it will be used instead of |g:jumptest_tag|.
