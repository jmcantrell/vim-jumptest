INTRODUCTION                                      *jumptest* *jumptest.vim*

In many unit-test systems, it's common for the tests to be stored alongside the
corresponding file that is being tested (e.g. 'foo_test.py' provides test
coverage for 'foo.py'). This plugin provides a command that jumps between these
two files.

CONFIGURATION                                     *jumptest-configuration*

g:jumptest_loaded                                 *g:jumptest_loaded*
    If set in your |vimrc|, jumptest.vim is not loaded.

g:jumptest_tag                                    *g:jumptest_tag*
    A |String| used as the identifier for the test file (e.g. if the main file
    is 'foo.py' and |g:jumptest_tag| is "_test", then the test file is expected
    to be 'foo_test.py').

b:jumptest_tag                                    *b:jumptest_tag*
    If this is set, it will be used instead of |g:jumptest_tag|.

If neither |b:jumptest_tag| nor |g:jumptest_tag| is set, then '_test' will be
used.

g:jumptest_prefix                                 *g:jumptest_prefix*
    A |String| used as a pattern to match everything in a file path up to the
    tag that identifies it as a test.

b:jumptest_prefix                                 *b:jumptest_prefix*
    If this is set, it will be used instead of |g:jumptest_prefix|.

If neither |b:jumptest_prefix| nor |g:jumptest_prefix| is set, then '[^/.]\+'
will be used, which matches on any string that does not contain a path
separator or a period. The default assumption is that the first period starts
the file extension.

g:jumptest_suffix                                 *g:jumptest_suffix*
    A |String| used as a pattern to match everything in a file path up to the
    tag that identifies it as a test.

b:jumptest_suffix                                 *b:jumptest_suffix*
    If this is set, it will be used instead of |g:jumptest_suffix|.

If neither |b:jumptest_suffix| nor |g:jumptest_suffix| is set, then
'\(\.[^/]\+\)\?$' will be used, which matches on an optional multi-extension.

FUNCTIONS                                         *jumptest-functions*

jumptest#alternate_file({fname})                  *jumptest#alternate_file()*
    Return the alternate filename of {fname}. If it is a test file, then the
    main file will be returned. If it's not a test file, then the test file
    will be returned.

jumptest#jump()                                   *jumptest#jump()*
    Does the same thing as |:JumpTest| but more convenient for scripting.

COMMANDS                                          *jumptest-commands*

                                                  *:JumpTest*
:JumpTest               Jump to/from the test file for the current buffer.
                        If the buffer has no file, nothing will happen.
